To subscribe to notifications for new test dates for the WA NIC Esthetics exam, download the nfty app and subscribe to nfty.sh/NIC-Esthetics-Alerts-Fife


My partner needed to register for a state licensing exam, but spots were limited and there was no way to subscribe to notifications for new test dates. This repo scrapes the page every 15 minutes using BeautifulSoup, parses the output using regular expressions, checks a repository of previously seen entries to ensure the date/time is new, then notifies subscribers using nfty.
